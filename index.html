	<h2>About me</h2>
	<p>
	My name is Stanley Valle and I am a returning college student. I garduated from Cal 
	Poly Pomona with a Bachelors in Business Administartion with an emphasis in Human Resources.
	I am coming back to school, because during the pandemic, I decided to continue to learn and
	enhance my skills in order to move up within my organization. I am currently working for 
	Cedars-Sinai in their Human Resource Service Center as a Recruiting and Onboarding Associate.
	I have been working for cedars for a year and 9 months and plan to be here for the long run. 
	I am trying to learn move up in the company as an HRIS analyst or as a workload management. 
	But of course, I have to wait until I have the experience or opportunity comes.

	  <li>Hanging out at breweries</li>
	  <li>Watching my favorite comedy podcasts (Your Moms House, Tiger Belly and 2 Bears, 1 Cave)</li>
	  <li>Taking at least an hour walk after work</li>
	</ol>

<p> My favorite website to visit is <a href="https://www.beeradvocate.com/">BeerAdvocate</a>, which helps me
